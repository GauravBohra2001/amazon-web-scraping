# amazon-web-scraping
The Amazon Web Scraping project is a Python script that extracts information about data engineering books from the Amazon UK website. It utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the webpage and retrieve details such as the book title, price, review count, and ratings. The extracted data is then stored in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
